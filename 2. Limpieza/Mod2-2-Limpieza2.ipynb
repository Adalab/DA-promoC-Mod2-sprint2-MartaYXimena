    " 1. Columna de species: si exploramos esta columna en detalle nos podemos dar cuenta que tenemos muchos valores únicos y esto hace que sea muy difícil trabajar con esta columna. Lo que vamos a hacer es clasificar los tiburones en 5 especies diferentes, las más comunes, que incluyen el tiburón blanco (White), el tiburón tigre (Tiger ), el tiburón gris (Grey), el tiburón limón (Lemon) y el tiburón toro (Bull). El resto de las especies las incluiremos en un único grupo que podremos llamar \"Unspecified\". Ahora nos podemos sentir un poco abrumadas y no saber como enfrentarnos a este reto, pero don't worry, os dejamos por aquí unas 💡 pistas 💡 para que os ayuden a entender cómo hacerlo."
